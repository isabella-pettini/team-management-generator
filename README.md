## Installation
Git clone this repo, run node index.js from the integrated vs code terminal, answer the prompts and look for your html file in the dist folder.

## Usage
Keeping track of your ever evolving team can require a lot of time and effort. This easy to use command line application will allow you to keep track of your team by choosing their role, entering their name, and their employee ID. Your Manager role will allow you to keep track of their office numbers. Your Engineer role will allow you to keep track of their GitHub account and your Intern role will allow you to keep track of the school they are currently enrolled in or graduated from. Once you have answered all of the prompts and no longer have employees to add, your HTML file will be generated in the dist folder where you can preview the page and code before deployment. This way you and your employees can have the vital contact information needed when collaborating in office or from home. Below is an example of how the page looks after you successfully input your employees.<br>
